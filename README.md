This project will be a full-stack portfolio and blog website. 

The general idea is to have a react.js front-end which will be used to display my software development and design portfolio
and a place where anyone can post blogs. While the portfolio section will be a static website the blog component will have some backend logic.

The backend will be in node.js express server. Communication between the frontend and backend will be done using RESTful commands handled by 
express. The general idea for now is to have the backend notify me by email when someone has wrote a blog which will be stored on a 
MongoDB database pending my approval to be displayed on the blog page.

Lastly, this application will be hosted on AWS.
